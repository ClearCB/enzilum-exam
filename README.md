## Description

This exam was base in cryptos and ethereum. It is important to first understand a little the concepts about it.

It is about a **concert** that someone called Rick created *tokens* with crypto technology. He created 100 of this tokens...

The app consist in how the tokens interact between users and how can someone adquire some of it.

The main data structure is a map which has a pair key value, in which the key is the **Publick Key** and the value is the tokens the user adquired.

They can also interact between ENziS, that is a coin similar in ethereum. They can transfer enzis and tokens.
